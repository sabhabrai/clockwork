	<img src="Nepal.jpg" alt="Image of mountians in nepal" width="200">
	<p>    I want to go to Nepal, where there are so many of my relatives. After many years seperated, I could finally meet my cousins, aunts, uncles, and my friends that are so close to me they are my relatives. Even though I cant remember any names, I can still remember them clearly. My aunt that I used to live with in Nepal. My cousins that I used to play outside with, so many nostalgic memories with them. I even went on adventures with my cousins, they were my siblings. If I could go anywhere, I would love to go to Nepal for my family.</p>

	<img src="Roosevelt.png" alt="image of Teddy Roosevelet" height="200">
	<p>I admire Teddy D Roosevelet, because of one of his speeches. During this speech, he got shot by John Schrank. Even though he got shot, he insited to continue his speech. This is what makes me admire him, this is what makes him a role model. He didnt give up, he wanted to give the public a speech, and he did even though he got shot.</p>
